# (some) OPDC projects

The folders contain some code from projects I worked on as an intern at the Oakland Planning and Development Corporation (OPDC). 

`code_enforcements`: collecting, mapping, and analyzing code enforcement violations in the neighborhood.

`oakwatch`: collecting data about crimes reported in Oakwatch community meetings from the past several months and creating graphs of the trends.

`trees!`: creating a map for all trees to be maintained or planted in the neighborhood.

Below the folders are Tableau packaged workbooks that contain the maps for these projects. You can download and open them in Tableau to view.
